### Kory Rosen
I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and Political Science with a Statistics concentration at Grinnell College and set to graduate in May 2024. My research experience includes working with Purdue University and the University of North Texas. At Purdue, my research centered on harnessing Large Language Models to analyze and generate synthetic demographic-specific responses. Meanwhile, at the University of North Texas, I explored an application of AI in high-energy physics. My passion, however, resides at the dynamic intersection of artificial intelligence and law.
