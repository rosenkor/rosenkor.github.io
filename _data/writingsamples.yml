     The essay examines the evolution and interpretation of the Commerce Clause in the U.S. Constitution.
     It focuses on key Supreme Court cases that have shaped the understanding of the Clause's reach in balancing state 
     and federal powers. The essay discusses the aggregation principle, introduced in the 20th century, which 
     allows Congress to regulate individual activities impacting interstate commerce when considered collectively.
     It reviews landmark cases like Wickard v. Filburn, Heart of Atlanta Motel Inc. v. United States, and 
     Katzenbach v. McClung, highlighting their roles in expanding the interpretation of the Commerce Clause. 
     The essay also delves into contrasting views on the Clause's interpretation, particularly examining 
     Chief Justice Rehnquist's standard in United States v. Lopez and subsequent cases like National Federation 
     of Independent Business v. Sebelius, presenting different judicial perspectives 
     on the balance between federal authority and state rights in contemporary society.
