  id: project1
  description: >
    Created an interactive R Shiny app to explore and visualize 278 Supreme Court case opinions spanning from 2019 to 2024. 
    Developed a robust data pipeline using Python to extract, transform, and load 842 rows of opinion data from 
    multiple endpoints of the CourtListener API. Utilized cutting-edge NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis, 
    topic modeling, and word cloud generation, to identify primary themes and sentiments within the opinion texts. 
    Streamlined data management using a PostgreSQL database, resulting in a 20% reduction in query latency and improved 
    app performance. Designed engaging visualizations using ggplot2 and plotly to highlight patterns in opinion lengths, 
    vote distributions, and author attributes.

    In collaboration with our community partner, Democratic Systems Inc. (DSI), created an interactive web application 
    using Vue.js and Flask to inform voters about the legislative actions of the Georgia delegation in the 117th United States 
    Congress on issues related to food insecurity. Developed a backend API using Flask to serve data from a MySQL database to the frontend.
    Utilized GeoJSON data to create an interactive map of the congressional districts within the State of Georgia, allowing users to click on 
    districts to view information about the corresponding representatives. Implemented a dropdown menu component to enable users to easily select 
    and view data for specific representatives. Designed an intuitive user interface to display representative biographies, committee assignments, 
    contact information, and voting records on relevant legislation.
