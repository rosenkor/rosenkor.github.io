  description: >
    Created an interactive R Shiny app to explore and visualize 278 Supreme Court case opinions spanning from 2019 to 2024. 
    Developed a robust data pipeline using Python to extract, transform, and load 842 rows of opinion data from 
    multiple endpoints of the CourtListener API. Utilized cutting-edge NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis, 
    topic modeling, and word cloud generation, to identify primary themes and sentiments within the opinion texts. 
    Streamlined data management using a PostgreSQL database, resulting in a 20% reduction in query latency and improved 
    app performance. Designed engaging visualizations using ggplot2 and plotly to highlight patterns in opinion lengths, 
    vote distributions, and author attributes.
