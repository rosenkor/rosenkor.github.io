## Academic

## Personal
Away from academia, my enthusiasm for tennis significantly enriches my life. I relish both playing the sport for fun and following professional tennis with keen interest. My admiration is especially drawn to players like Su-wei Hsieh, whose ingenious and unpredictable gameplay captivates me, reflecting the importance of creativity and adaptability in life. Venus Williams, a symbol of strength and trailblazing success, inspires me with her extraordinary career resilience and ability to overcome challenges. Diego Schwartzman, notable for his incredible skill and perseverance despite being shorter than most of his counterparts, exemplifies the power of determination and strategic intelligence. Rafael Nadal, renowned for his mastery on clay and relentless pursuit of excellence, stands as a testament to dedication, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of goals.

At home, my time is often brightened by the presence of my dog, Brûlée. Our interactions, whether it's a walk or simply relaxing together, provide a welcome change of pace from my academic pursuits. Brûlée adds a dimension of straightforward, uncomplicated joy to my life, reminding me of the value of balance and the simple pleasures of daily living.
