## Academic

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Tulane University, where I am advised by Dr. Aron Culotta. I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts from Grinnell College, majoring in Computer Science and Political Science with a concentration in Statistics. At Grinnell, under the mentorship of Professor Peter-Michael Osera and Professor Gemma Sala, my academic journey was marked by both rigorous coursework and research experiences focused on the intersection of technology and societal impact.

My venture into the world of Large Language Models at Purdue University allowed me to analyze and generate synthetic samples of demographic-specific responses, offering me a unique perspective on the interplay of technology, language, and societal dynamics. Concurrently, my stint at the University of North Texas involved a deep learning project in high-energy physics, where I explored the use of variational autoencoders for particle identification. These experiences have significantly broadened my technical acumen and understanding of AI's potential in scientific research.

Driven by a high school project that first sparked my interest, I have nurtured a passion for the ethical implications and applications of AI in legal systems. This interest is not merely academic; it's underpinned by a strong commitment to ensuring that the advancement of AI technology aligns with ethical standards and bolsters societal well-being. My aim is to contribute to the development of AI tools that promote fairness and privacy, ensuring that the revolutionary impact of artificial intelligence is harnessed responsibly. As I continue my Ph.D., I am eager to contribute to the intersection of AI, law, and society by leveraging my expertise in both computer science and political science.

## Personal
Away from academia, my enthusiasm for tennis significantly enriches my life. I relish both playing the sport for fun and following professional tennis with keen interest. My admiration is especially drawn to players like Su-wei Hsieh, whose ingenious and unpredictable gameplay captivates me, reflecting the importance of creativity and adaptability in life. Venus Williams, a symbol of strength and trailblazing success, inspires me with her extraordinary career resilience and ability to overcome challenges. Diego Schwartzman, notable for his incredible skill and perseverance despite being shorter than most of his counterparts, exemplifies the power of determination and strategic intelligence. Rafael Nadal, renowned for his mastery on clay and relentless pursuit of excellence, stands as a testament to dedication, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of goals.

At home, my time is often brightened by the presence of my dog, Brûlée. Our interactions, whether it's a walk or simply relaxing together, provide a welcome change of pace from my academic pursuits. Brûlée adds a dimension of straightforward, uncomplicated joy to my life, reminding me of the value of balance and the simple pleasures of daily living.
