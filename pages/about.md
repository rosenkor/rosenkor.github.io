## Academic

I am an undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor of Arts at Grinnell College, majoring in Computer Science and Political Science with a concentration in Statistics. Under the guidance of my major advisors, Professor Peter-Michael Osera in Computer Science and Professor Gemma Sala in Political Science, my journey at Grinnell College is poised to culminate in May 2024. This path has been characterized not just by rigorous coursework but also by transformative research experiences, particularly in the intersection of technology and societal impact.

My venture into the world of Large Language Models at Purdue University allowed me to analyze and generate synthetic samples of demographic-specific responses, offering me a unique perspective on the interplay of technology, language, and societal dynamics. Concurrently, my stint at the University of North Texas involved a deep learning project in high-energy physics, where I explored the use of variational autoencoders for particle identification. These experiences have significantly broadened my technical acumen and understanding of AI's potential in scientific research.

Driven by a high school project that first sparked my interest, I have nurtured a passion for the ethical implications and applications of AI in legal systems. This interest is not merely academic; it's underpinned by a strong commitment to ensuring that the advancement of AI technology aligns with ethical standards and bolsters societal well-being. My aim is to contribute to the development of AI tools that promote fairness and privacy, ensuring that the revolutionary impact of artificial intelligence is harnessed responsibly.

As I approach the completion of my undergraduate degree, I am enthusiastically looking forward to applying my skills and knowledge to tackle complex challenges at the nexus of artificial intelligence, law, and society. My goal is to leverage my academic foundation in computer science and political science to make meaningful contributions to the evolving landscape of AI and its role in our world, particularly in the context of legal and ethical frameworks.

## Personal
Away from academia, my enthusiasm for tennis significantly enriches my life. I relish both playing the sport for fun and following professional tennis with keen interest. My admiration is especially drawn to players like Su-wei Hsieh, whose ingenious and unpredictable gameplay captivates me, reflecting the importance of creativity and adaptability in life. Venus Williams, a symbol of strength and trailblazing success, inspires me with her extraordinary career resilience and ability to overcome challenges. Diego Schwartzman, notable for his incredible skill and perseverance despite being shorter than most of his counterparts, exemplifies the power of determination and strategic intelligence. Rafael Nadal, renowned for his mastery on clay and relentless pursuit of excellence, stands as a testament to dedication, resilience, and the relentless pursuit of goals.

At home, my time is often brightened by the presence of my dog, Brûlée. Our interactions, whether it's a walk or simply relaxing together, provide a welcome change of pace from my academic pursuits. Brûlée adds a dimension of straightforward, uncomplicated joy to my life, reminding me of the value of balance and the simple pleasures of daily living.
